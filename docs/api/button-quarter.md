# Adding the 1/4 Button to Product Detail:
1.	A new button is added to the e-shop's product detail page that opens the calculator (widget or API) and the client confirms their installment selection.
2.	The e-shop saves the definition of the product set chosen by the client and inserts it as the preferred option into createApplication


# Instructions for Inserting the Button:

1)	Insert code #1 on the e-shop page, in the place where we want to display the HC calculator
2)	Insert code #2 anywhere on the e-shop pages (can be right below part #1 or anywhere scripts are located)
3)	Modify the line in script #2 where the hcCalcPrice variable is defined so that the value is taken from the product value, where hcCalcPrice is the price including VAT

# Instructions for Inserting the Preferred Product Definition into createApplication:
•	The saved definition of the client's preferred product is inserted when creating an order (createApplication) into the settingInstallment section:

```json
{
  "settingsInstallment": {
    "preferredMonths": 0,
    "preferredInstallment": {
      "amount": 75900,
      "currency": "CZK"
    },
    "preferredDownPayment": {
      "amount": 0,
      "currency": "CZK"
    },
    "productCode": "COCONL15",
    "productSetCode": "COCHCONL"
  }
}
```

•	The product is defined by 3 parameters:
* preferredInstallment - installment amount
* productCode - product code
* productSetCode - product set code
